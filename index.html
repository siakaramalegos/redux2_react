# React + Redux

A fine combination

<aside class="notes"><p>What use is Redux without a user-facing application? We learned Redux to better manage our state in our React apps, so it&#39;s time to start using it as such. Remember, Redux is not exclusive to React and can be used with many JavaScript front-end libraries or even vanilla JavaScript.</p>

## React Redux

You could write all your React + Redux code yourself using `store.subscribe()`, but the [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) package comes with helper methods that are also more performant.

## React Redux Data Flows

**Data still always flows one-way:**

1. Dispatch an action from the view.
2. Maybe dispatch functions or other actions from that action.
3. The reducer listens for the actions and returns a new state to the store.
4. The view listens for updates to the store and receives the new state.

### React + Redux

- Components vs Containers
- Building Containers
- Async Actions

# Components vs Containers

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

> **Containers** manage or connect to state and actions, while **presentational components** render based on props only.

<aside class="notes"><p>This is a good pattern for both larger applications with deeper component trees (multiple levels) as well as any React application which uses Redux.</p>
</aside></script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Presentational Components

- Primarily concerned with the "presentation", or how things look.
- Go by many names, including stateless functional, dumb, stateless, skinny, and functional (though in the future, [functional components can have state](https://twitter.com/sebmarkbage/status/658713924607606784)).
- Should almost always be functional components.
- All the data (from state) and actions they need are passed to them as props.
- Thus, very easy to test!

<aside class="notes"><p>They should rarely be class-based, and usually do not have their own state. Any state would be solely used for UI purposes, though many developers prefer this to be stored in Redux as well.</p>
</aside></script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Containers

- Primarily concerned with how things work.
- Go by many other names including smart, class-based, stateful, and fat components.
- In Redux apps, they connect with the store to link state and provide dispatch actions.
- Always class-based components.
- Generally, the render method should be minimal.

<aside class="notes"><p>It usually only calls a presentational component with a corresponding name. For example, the <code>AppContainer</code> would render the <code>App</code> component.</p>
</aside></script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Separation Pattern Benefits

- Better separation of concerns
- Easier to recognize code smells
- Greater reusability for presentational components
- Designers love presentational components because of [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).
- Less fragility if the shape of the data structure changes.
- Easier testing!

<aside class="notes"><p>(1) One focuses on the user interface, and the other connects the business state and actions. (2) large components doing too many things that would lead to difficult-to-debug issues (3)</p>

## Puppy Adoption Agency

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/viking_education/web_development/web_app_eng/pug_life_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of puppy adoption agency app" width="60%">

<aside class="notes"><p>We will build the view for our puppy adoption agency application that we began in the Redux section. Let&#39;s start with a puppy list which shows each puppy with a link to adopt each one. So, we need: puppy list, puppy card, button</p>
</aside></script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## You Do:

Set up the app to use [reactstrap](https://github.com/reactstrap/reactstrap) components:

- Add reactstrap and bootstrap packages:
```bash
yarn add bootstrap@4.0.0 reactstrap@next
```
- In `src/index.js`, import bootstrap css:
```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```
- To use:
```javascript
import { Button } from 'reactstrap';
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## You Do:

Build the starting presentational components, one option:

- `PuppyList` - props are `puppies` array and `adoptPuppy` event
- `PuppyCard` - props are `puppy` and `adoptPuppy` event
- `AdoptButton` - props are `available` and `onClick` event

<img src="./images/puppies_list.png" alt="Screenshot of puppy adoption agency app" width="60%">

<aside class="notes"><p>Let&#39;s quickly build our presentational components for our puppy list. Remember, these should rely solely on props to access data and events.</p>

# Building Containers

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Containers do 3-ish primary things:

- Connect to the store to:
  - Read data from state into props
  - Map dispatch actions into props for UI events
- Render the associated presentational component

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## React Bindings For Redux

The [react-redux package](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) is less onerous and more performant than writing our own bindings. It gives us:

- `connect([mapStateToProps], [mapDispatchToProps], [mergeProps], [options])` - connects a React component to a Redux store
- `<Provider store>` - makes the Redux store available to all `connect()` calls in the descendent tree

```bash
$ npm install react-redux --save
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Implementing `<Provider/>`

Usually initialize the store and set up the Provider in the same file where you call the root component, **index.js**:

```javascript
// index.js
// Import React and render,
import React from 'react'
import { render } from 'react-dom'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import puppiesApp from './reducers'
import App from './components/App'

let store = createStore(puppiesApp)

render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

<aside class="notes"><p>So what exactly does the <code>&lt;Provider&gt;</code> component do? It provides access to the store from any component below the <code>&lt;App /&gt;</code> component that calls the <code>connect()</code> function. It seems like magic, but really it is just taking advantage of <code>context</code> in React. If you&#39;re curious and like rabbit holes, check out the docs listed in the resources.</p>
</aside></script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Map State To Props

To send data to the presentational component, define a `mapStateToProps` function which accepts `state` as an input and outputs the desired data fields in `props`.

```javascript
const mapStateToProps = (state) => {
  return {
    puppies: state.puppies,
  }
}
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## ownProps

To grab any props that were passed to the container, then pass a secondary (optional) argument, `ownProps`:

```javascript
// Return a prop called `active` that checks whether the
// current filter in state is equal to the `filter` prop
// of the container
const mapStateToProps = (state, ownProps) => {
  return {
    active: state.puppyFilter === ownProps.filter,
  }
}
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Map Dispatch To Props

To send actions, define `mapDispatchToProps` which accepts `dispatch` from Redux as an input:

```javascript
// Map dispatch to props to create a click function that
// dispatches puppy adoption
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    onAdoptPuppyClick: (id) => {
      dispatch(adoptPuppy(id))
    }
  }
}
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## ownProps

Similar to `mapStateToProps`, we can pass a secondary (optional) argument, `ownProps`, to the function whenever we need access to the props given to the container:

```javascript
// Map dispatch to props to create a click function that
// dispatches setting the availability filter
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, ownProps) => {
  return {
    onClick: (e) => {
      e.preventDefault()
      dispatch(setAvailabilityFilter(ownProps.filter))
    }
  }
}
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Connecting

Finally, we can use the `connect()` function from the React-Redux bindings to generate our container:

```javascript
// Import the function from React-Redux
import {connect} from 'react-redux'

// ..

// Generate the PuppyListContainer
const PuppyListContainer = connect(
  mapStateToProps,
  mapDispatchToProps
)(PuppyList)
```

<aside class="notes"><p><code>connect()</code> technically returns a function which we immediately invoke by passing in the component that we want the props to be injected in. Comes with performance enhancements like preventing unnecessary re-renders.</p>
</aside></script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## More on Mapping to Props

`mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` are optional and solely for passing in to `connect()`.

- Any time that the store `state` updates, `mapStateToProps` will be called, thus updating the values mapped to `props`.
- `mapDispatchToProps` injects `dispatch` into the action creator functions provided in the returned object.

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## You Do: Wire up React + Redux!

- Install React bindings: `yarn add react-redux`
- Wrap `<App>` in a `<Provider store={store}>`
- `connect()` a `<PuppiesListContainer/>` to get the store puppies and the adopt action creator into the `<PuppiesList/>` props

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Bonus: Bind Action Creators

Redux conveniently provides `bindActionCreators()` which will automatically map the actions to dispatch:

```javascript
// Without bindActionCreators()
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  return {
    adoptPuppy: (id) => { dispatch(adoptPuppy(id)) },
    createPuppy: (data) => { dispatch(createPuppy(data))},
    updatePuppy: (data) => { dispatch(updatePuppy(data))},
    deletePuppy: (data) => { dispatch(deletePuppy(data))},
  }
}

// With bindActionCreators()
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => {
  const actions = {adoptPuppy, createPuppy, updatePuppy, deletePuppy}
  return bindActionCreators(actions, dispatch)
}
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Bonus: Preloaded State

Sometimes you want to initialize your application with data loaded from a server or API.

- `createStore()` accepts a second, optional argument of preloaded state.
- It must match up with the shape of the state in the store.

```javascript
const puppiesFromServer = // response from server/API call

// Create the store, passing in the reducer as the
// first argument, and a new preloaded state argument
let store = createStore(puppiesApp, {
  puppies: puppiesFromServer
})
```

<aside class="notes"><p>We always set default state in the reducers, but we can also add a <a href="http://redux.js.org/docs/api/createStore.html">preloaded state</a> when we create the store.</p>

# Async Redux Actions

<img src="./images/headless_dog.gif" alt="Weird dog head">


<aside class="notes"><p>We learned how to perform async requests in vanilla React, but now we need them in Redux. Unfortunately, Redux can only perform synchronous actions out-of-the-box. What is a developer to do?!?! Don&#39;t fret because the writer of Redux built in a way to add middleware that allows us to extend the functionality of what we can do in Redux. Phew!</p>
</aside></script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Redux is only synchronous.

So how would we perform async actions like API calls to fetch data?

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Middleware to the Rescue!

- Middleware is an optional extension that operates after an action is dispatched but before the action hits the reducer.
- You can write your own middleware code or use external packages like [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk), [Redux Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga), or [Redux Promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise).
- You can use multiple middleware packages in a single application.

<aside class="notes"><p>We use middleware primarily for adding asynchronous actions to call APIs, but it can also be used for logging, crash reporting, and other use cases as well.</p>
</aside></script>
        </section>

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Adding Middleware

Use `applyMiddleware(...middleware)` as the *last* argument in the `createStore()` call:

```javascript
// Creating a store with two middlewares
let store = createStore(
  myReducer,
  applyMiddleware(myMiddleware1, myMiddleware2)
)

// Creating a store with both preloaded state and
// one middleware
let store = createStore(
  myReducer,
  myPreloadedState,
  applyMiddleware(myMiddleware)
)
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## Redux Thunk

Action creators that return a function instead of an action.

- Thunks can delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.
- The inner function receives the store methods `dispatch` and `getState` as parameters.

```javascript
export const fetchPuppies = () => (dispatch) => {
  dispatch(requestPuppies())

  fetch(puppiesURL)
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(json => {
      dispatch(receivePuppies(json.puppies))
    })
    .catch(err => {
      throw new Error(err)
    })
}
```

</script>
        </section>
        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

## You Do:

- Add redux-thunk package `yarn add redux-thunk`
- Add the middleware to your store `createStore(reducers, applyMiddleware(thunk))`
- Create request and receive puppies actions
- Create async fetch puppies action
- Load your puppies in `componentDidMount` for `PuppiesListContainer` (requires some refactoring)
